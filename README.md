<h1>accessibleMath</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>

Plug-in for Microsoft Office to create accessible equations using MathML. Interface allows button selection and LaTeX input and converts equations to MathML and MathJax.

This project is being done <i>in parallel</i> with Project 1 for CSAER. 

<h2>Background</h2>
Program accessibility refers to the ability for people with disabilities to read and interpret data with the same degree of accuracy as any other person would.

The current Microsoft Office equation editor does not produce resources that are accessible for screen reading software. There exists proprietary software that achieves these ends but it can end up being quite expensive. People with disabilities should not have to pay high fees to access extremely common documentation like equations, so the goal of this project is to create an open-source variation in the form of an Office Add-In.

<h2>Implementation</h2>
As of <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/dev/add-ins/overview/office-add-ins">March 2019</a>, Office permits the use of web-development-related languages like JavaScript in the implementation of Office Add-Ins. Previously, Office add-ins required the use of proprietary technologies like VBA and .NET.

<h2>Features</h2>
The add-in will create a pop-up window that permits users to click on buttons corresponding with  mathematical symbols including but not limited to an integral, sigma notation, a cross product, and a vast number of other mathematical features. Alternatively, a user can use LaTeX notation for input (e.g., \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}).

<h2>People</h2>
Please let Brendan Tschuy if you'd like to contribute. I plan on starting this the week of 5/12.
